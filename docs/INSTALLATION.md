# Running Devty Locally

Following are the steps to run devty locally:

- Create a new directory where devty will reside,
- git clone this repo, use `git clone https://github.com/pratyushtiwary/devty.git`
- install dependecies using a package manager such as `npm` or `yarn`
- Once all dependencies are installed you can run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` to start dev server and paste the displayed URL in your browser.

âœ¨ If you've followed all the steps above correctly you will now have a local instace of devty running!
